# MVC Movie Viewer
 
This project mimics a website that would be used to watched movies. This website has user accounts where the user can look at their profile, and view a list of watched movies.

The data that this site uses is stored on a local database, as a result of that if the project is ran it will not work correctly.

This project was created for my Advanced Web Design class my Senior year.
